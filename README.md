## Brief introduction of the program
    The test image I used is "book.jpg" (version 1 & 2) and "dri_lic.png" (version 3). < > 
    The first image is a book cover which I think is very suitable for this project. The book cover image, which I took a picture of it, comes from school's library. The text on the book cover has different color and size, capital letters and the caligraphy letters. While the driver license image comes from internet.
